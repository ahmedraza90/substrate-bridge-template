// 1. A trait that says "I am the same as type T"
trait IsType<T> {}

// 2. Blanket impl: Any type is IsType with itself
impl<T> IsType<T> for T {}

// 3. Now test it on a custom struct
struct MyType;
struct SameType;

// Only works if SameType = MyType
fn check_if_same_type<T: IsType<U>, U>(_value: T) {
    println!("Yes! T is the same as U.");
}

fn main() {
    let value = MyType;
    
    // This works: T == U
    check_if_same_type::<MyType, MyType>(value);

    // Uncommenting this will cause error: T != U
    // check_if_same_type::<MyType, SameType>(value);
}


❓ Why Use IsType<T> If T == T Anyway?


//AS

<Self as SomeTrait>::SomeType

Because the same struct might implement multiple traits that have the same associated type name — like:

trait A {
    type Thing;
}
trait B {
    type Thing;
}
If a struct implements both A and B, and you write Self::Thing, it’s ambiguous — which one do you mean?

So you write:

<Self as A>::Thing // to be clear you're referring to A's Thing






🔧 Imagine Two Pallets:
Each pallet defines its own Event enum.

But the runtime (whole blockchain) needs a single unified RuntimeEvent that includes all pallet events.

Now, inside the pallet, you want to write generic code that says:

“Whatever type you give me as RuntimeEvent, make sure it’s the same as the system-wide runtime event type.”

Here’s what Substrate does:
type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;

This says:

"You (the runtime) can give me any type you want as RuntimeEvent, but you must prove:

You can convert this pallet’s event into it (via From<Event<Self>>).

It's the same type as the system's event type — enforced by IsType."


🛡️ IsType<T> = "Type compatibility contract"


🗣️ “Dear runtime, whatever type you pass into me as RuntimeEvent, make sure it’s the exact same as your system’s RuntimeEvent. Otherwise, compile error.”

That way:

The pallet stays flexible (it doesn't assume what the outer runtime's event type is).
The compiler checks the types match.

how types becomes compatible to eachother:
it is necessary for the types to implement IsType to be compatible to each other. So RuntimeEvent of every pallet should implement IsType to make it compatible with the RuntimeEvent of Config trait from frame_system.
However, in Substrate, this is typically handled automatically by the construct_runtime! macro, so you don’t need to manually implement IsType for each pallet’s RuntimeEvent.

Compatibility means the pallet’s RuntimeEvent can act as or be used in place of frame_system::Config’s RuntimeEvent, either because they’re the same type or because one can be converted to the other.
EXAMPLE:
// Two different event types with same data
struct BasicEvent(String);
struct FancyEvent(String);

// Make FancyEvent compatible with BasicEvent
impl IsType<BasicEvent> for FancyEvent {}

// Make BasicEvent compatible with itself
impl IsType<BasicEvent> for BasicEvent {}


COMPLETE EXAMPLE:
// Mimic Substrate’s IsType
trait IsType<T> {}

// Base trait, like frame_system::Config
trait System {
    type Event;
}

// Pallet trait, like Config
trait Pallet {
    type Event: IsType<<Self as System>::Event>;
}

// Base event type: simple
struct BasicEvent {
    message: String,
}

// Fancy event type: extra field and method
struct FancyEvent {
    message: String,
    timestamp: u64, // Different field
}

// Add a method to FancyEvent
impl FancyEvent {
    fn log(&self) {
        println!("Event logged at {}", self.timestamp);
    }
}

// Compatibility implementations
impl IsType<BasicEvent> for BasicEvent {}
impl IsType<BasicEvent> for FancyEvent {} // FancyEvent is compatible despite differences

// Runtime, like Test
struct Runtime;

impl System for Runtime {
    type Event = BasicEvent;
}

impl Pallet for Runtime {
    type Event = FancyEvent; // Works because FancyEvent implements IsType<BasicEvent>
}

fn main() {
    let basic = BasicEvent {
        message: String::from("Hello"),
    };
    let fancy = FancyEvent {
        message: String::from("Hello"),
        timestamp: 123456,
    };
    fancy.log(); // FancyEvent has a method BasicEvent doesn’t
    println!("Both compile!");
}



Connecting to Your Substrate Code

// Your Substrate Config trait:

pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
}

// In your mock.rs:

impl system::Config for Test {
    type Event = RuntimeEvent;
}
impl my_pallet::Config for Test {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
}

Substrate’s design: The runtime needs a unified event type. IsType ensures all pallets’ RuntimeEvent types align with frame_system’s, even if they’re not identical.
 

FINAL EXAMPLE:
// Mimic Substrate’s IsType
trait IsType<T> {}

// Like frame_system::Config
trait SystemConfig {
    type Event;
}

// Like pallet Config
trait PalletConfig: SystemConfig {
    type Event: IsType<<Self as SystemConfig>::Event>;
}

// Standard event type
struct StandardEvent {
    message: String,
}

// Custom event type for a pallet
struct CustomEvent {
    message: String,
    priority: u32, // Extra field
}

// Manual IsType implementations
impl IsType<StandardEvent> for StandardEvent {}
impl IsType<StandardEvent> for CustomEvent {} // CustomEvent is compatible

// Runtime
struct Runtime;

impl SystemConfig for Runtime {
    type Event = StandardEvent;
}

// Pallet using custom event
impl PalletConfig for Runtime {
    type Event = CustomEvent; // Works because CustomEvent implements IsType<StandardEvent>
}

fn main() {
    println!("Compiles!");
}

Key Points:

StandardEvent and CustomEvent are different (extra priority field).
impl IsType<StandardEvent> for CustomEvent makes CustomEvent compatible with StandardEvent.
This allows CustomEvent in PalletConfig, even though SystemConfig uses StandardEvent.
In Substrate, construct_runtime! avoids this manual step by using a single RuntimeEvent enum.

Your Config trait:

pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    type RuntimeEvent: From<Event<Self>> + IsType<<Self as frame_system::Config>::RuntimeEvent>;
}

Every pallet: Each pallet’s Config trait has a similar RuntimeEvent bound, requiring IsType compatibility with frame_system::Config’s RuntimeEvent.
Automatic in mock.rs: The construct_runtime! macro creates a RuntimeEvent enum that includes all pallets’ events and implements IsType<RuntimeEvent> for RuntimeEvent. This satisfies the bound for all pallets without manual IsType implementations.
Rare manual case: If a pallet used a custom RuntimeEvent type (not the standard enum), you’d need to implement IsType manually, like in the example above.
Why it seems simple in mock.rs:

Both my_pallet::Config and frame_system::Config use the same RuntimeEvent, so IsType is trivially satisfied (same type implements IsType for itself).
But IsType allows flexibility for cases where types differ, unlike hardcoding.


Traits and Box: IsType is a trait bound, like bounds in Box<dyn Clone> where a type must implement Clone.

What is a Trait Bound?
A trait bound is a rule in Rust that says, “This type must follow certain behaviors or properties.” It’s like telling Rust, “Only let types that can do X, Y, or Z be used here.”
