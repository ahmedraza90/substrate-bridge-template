FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS:
bridges: This folder helps connect different blockchains so they can talk to each other and share information.
cumulus: This folder is for creating smaller blockchains (called parachains) that work together with a bigger blockchain like Polkadot.
scripts: Holds scripts for automating tasks like building, testing, or deploying the project.
substrate: The core framework for building blockchains. It provides the foundational components like runtime modules (pallets), networking, and consensus mechanisms.
target: This is where the computer puts the files it creates when you build or compile the project.
templates: Contains boilerplate or starter code for creating new projects, such as 

Connections:
substrate: is the foundation of the project, providing the core blockchain framework. Other components like cumulus and bridges build on top of it.
cumulus: extends substrate to enable parachain functionality, allowing blockchains to connect to Polkadot or Kusama.
bridges: interacts with both substrate and cumulus to enable cross-chain communication.
umbrella: acts as a central hub, re-exporting components from substrate, cumulus, and bridges for easier integration.
scripts: automate tasks across all these components, such as building parachains or deploying bridges.
templates: provide starting points for creating new parachains or runtime modules, leveraging substrate and cumulus.

Substrate Folder:
Purpose: The substrate folder contains the core blockchain framework. It provides the foundational tools and libraries for building blockchains, including runtime modules (pallets), networking, consensus mechanisms, and client-side components.
Scope: It is a general-purpose framework that can be used to build any blockchain, not just Polkadot. It is modular and extensible, allowing developers to create custom blockchains with specific features.

Polkadot Folder:
Purpose: The polkadot folder contains the implementation of the Polkadot relay chain. It specializes the Substrate framework to create the Polkadot blockchain, which acts as the relay chain for connecting parachains.
Scope: It is specific to the Polkadot ecosystem and focuses on implementing the relay chain logic, governance, and shared security for parachains.
