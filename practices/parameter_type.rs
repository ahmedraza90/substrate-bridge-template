Without parameter_types! (Wrong Way ❌)
rustimpl VendingMachineConfig for MyVendingMachine {
    type MaxItems = 50;        // ❌ This won't work!
    type ItemPrice = 2;        // ❌ This won't work!
}

Config implementation says : "I don't want raw numbers! I want something that can GIVE me the numbers when I ask!"


With parameter_types! (Right Way ✅)
rust// Step 1: Create "label makers" that can print values
parameter_types! {
    pub const MaxItems: u32 = 50;
    pub const ItemPrice: u32 = 2;
}


When you write:
rustparameter_types! {
    pub const BlockHashCount: u32 = 2400;
}
It's like creating a robot that only knows one thing:
rust// This is what the macro creates (simplified):
pub struct BlockHashCount;  // A robot named BlockHashCount

impl BlockHashCount {
    // The robot can answer one question: "What's your value?"
    pub fn get() -> u32 {
        2400  // It always answers: "2400"
    }
}
Why Do We Need This?
Substrate pallets are like strict teachers. When you configure them, they say:

"Don't give me a number. Give me something that KNOWS the number!"
