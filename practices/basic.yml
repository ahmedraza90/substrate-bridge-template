Relay Chain

The main Polkadot network
Core blockchain that coordinates the entire system
Provides shared security and consensus

Parachains

Custom blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain
Each can have specialized functions/features
Benefit from Relay Chain's security

Bridges

Connect Polkadot to external blockchains (like Ethereum, Bitcoin)
Allow for cross-ecosystem communication

Consensus Engine

Handles finality and security for the network
Ensures all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain

Pallets

Modular, reusable components
Building blocks for blockchain functionality
Examples: balances, governance, staking

Runtime

Combines various pallets into blockchain logic
Defines how the blockchain processes transactions
Determines state transition rules

XCMP (Cross-Chain Message Passing)

Protocol for parachains to communicate with each other
Enables interoperability between parachains.

Facilitates cross-chain messaging
Enables asset transfers between chains
Provides programmable messaging with features like branching logic and safe dispatches

Substrate SDK

The framework underpinning everything
Provides tools and libraries to build blockchains
Foundation of the entire Polkadot ecosystem



Cumulus
Cumulus extends Substrate chains with parachain capabilities, allowing them to connect to the Polkadot network. It:

Transforms Substrate-based chains into Polkadot-compatible parachains
Converts Substrate nodes into parachain nodes
Simplifies integration with the Polkadot ecosystem
